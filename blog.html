        <img src="./images/img1.jpg" class="blog_img">
        <p class="blog_para">An Adventure is something very challenging and exciting. Adventure is totally different from our normal and 
            ordinary life. An adventure involves challenging ourselves or trying out something new in life.</p>
            <p class="blog_para">Remember innovation is very important in our life same as adventure also plays a very important role because 
                following the same schedule makes people bored and Irritated. The word adventure usually has positive 
                connotations. Though it may be challenging, an adventure usually makes us feel energized. There are different
                 types of adventure like Climbing a mountain, Learning a new language, Exploring the new city, river rafting and 
                 Rock climbing.</p>
                 <img src="./images/img2.jpg" class="blog_img">
                 <p class="blog_para">There are many reasons to know the importance of adventure in our life as adventure provide positive attitude 
                     he same way it releases our stress and mental problem because of the excitement and happiness we experience 
                     during the adventure take us away from normal hectic life to a new happy life at least for sometimes.</p>
         <p class="blog_para">Further Adventure is typically a bold, sometimes risky and undertaking experience. In my opinion, everyone in this 
             world should prefer to do the adventurous activity and I can bet once you tried you will really love it. It not only
              provides inner happiness but also change our mind externally.</p>
              <p class="blog_para">Adventure provide us with vast knowledge and experience. It takes us from the hectic life to a refreshed one. 
                  I would like to suggest all the people to go for adventurous activity. Life is incomplete without adventure.
                   So try it and Enjoy it.</p>
